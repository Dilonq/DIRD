# Task Force Squad Organization

## Overview

Squads will be separated into groups of four, with each individual possessing a role based on said individual's skill set. Task Force example names will be shortened to "XX". A more realistic example could be Task Force Epsilon-11, while the shortened name would be E11

### Agent

The Agent, designated XX-1, will be in charge of all other squad members, having the final say in any necessary decision made by the squad, unless all other squad members disagree unanimously. XX-1 also has the duty of investigating any incidents that take place within the facility. If no incidents have occurred, XX-1 will focus on completing maintenance tasks around the facility.

### Scribe
The Scribe, designated XX-2, has the duty of logging anything of interest that happens during the mission.

### Technician
The Technician, designated XX-3, has the duty of fixing any sabotages or other problems the facility undergoes during the mission. 

### Security
The Security, designated XX-4, has the duty of keeping tabs on all members of the squad and any other personnel present during the mission. In intervals of a minimum of twenty (20) seconds, XX-4 will cease surveillance to complete any amount of tasks they deem fit.

## Task Force Operation

### Performing Tasks

Squad Members will stick together as either a full squad or in pairs at all times. [NEEDS REVISION]

### Performing Without Communication

Task Forces will have to go without communication for much of the mission, making it critical for each member to fully understand their role and what they should do in any given situation.

### Casualties

In the event that an insurgent, mutation, or any other threat taking the life of a squad member, operation MUST go as normal, with as minimal change as possible.
