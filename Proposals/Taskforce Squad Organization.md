# Task Force Squad Organization Proposal

## Overview

Squads will be separated into groups of four, with each individual possessing a role based on said individual's skill set. Task Force example names will be shortened to "XX". A more realistic example could be Task Force Epsilon-11, or Task Force Bravo-2

### Squad Leader

The Squad Leader, designated XX-1, will be in charge of all other squad members, having the final say in any necessary decision made by the squad.

### Scribe
The Scribe, designated XX-2, has the duty of logging anything of interest that happens during the mission.

### Medic
The Medic, designated XX-3, has the duty of protecting other squad members from potential threats during the mission.

### Security
The Security, designated XX-4, has the duty of keeping tabs on all members of the squad and any other personnel present during the mission.
