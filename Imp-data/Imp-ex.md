IMP-010 attacks by shooting it's target, hereby designated IMP-010-1, in the head with a standard-issue M1911 handgun. IMP-010 will then flee the scene using the nearest possible exit, trying to find a group of crewman IMP-010 can join. If IMP-010-1 is found and reported, IMP-010 puts one (1) of two (2) strategies into play, choosing based on whichever is more likely to succeed. IMP-010's first strategy is to remain silent throughout the entire discussion, unless directly addressed. IMP-010 usually possesses an alibi, stating that IMP-010 was far away from IMP-010-1, and was currently completing tasks. IMP-010's secondary strategy is to act as an investigator, spearheading accusations against crewmen found nearest to IMP-010-1, or other suspicious crewmen.
