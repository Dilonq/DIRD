The Acid Mutation.This one's a bit more prominent than the Poison Mutation,it's deadly for sure.It's behavior is that it buddies up with a crewmate,leads them to a isolated place,then gives them a hug.The hug sends acid from it's claws to the victim's blood,it may be small pain at first,then it grows into a burning feeling,melting the victim from the inside.The dead giveaway is it's claws on it's hands,if you see crewmates with claws, eject them.

 The first incident of the acid mutation happend on 28/02/2048 at Potus, When a crewmate asked another crewmate if they were feeling okay, the crewmate said that he had a hug from his "buddy",then he said that the pain started out small then grew into feeling like he's burning alive.Then the crewmate spotted two claw scars on the back of his fellow crewmate, he checked eveyone and saw one "crewmate" with claws, he then assumed it was the imposter, he was right.That's the first incident of the acid mutation,several more incidents happend after that.
