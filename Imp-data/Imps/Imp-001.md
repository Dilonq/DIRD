**Item #:** 
IMP-001

**Codename:** 
Ribbon

**Status:**
Unknown?

**Description:** 
The Ribbon mutation is one of the most deadly, because of it's behavior. It will make it's self seem scared, or frightened, to make it easier to group up with a crewmate. After this it will isolate, and completely devour it's victim, only leaving a hand or foot on the floor. Dead giveaways is the Ribbons drool, which will make it look like its sweating. Vote off any "crewmates" that show this behavior, and you'll be safe.

**Incident Log:**

[12/06/2043]

Video feed showed a Ribbon isolate and kill a crewmate before being found exflitrating through a nearby vent. After this, many more incidents happened. The 101th Polus incident was when the Reversed Ribbon first appeared. Since all we have is video evidence, heres what we know about this sub-mutation. It's tongue is venomous and causes necrosis, its more prone to kill when called out, and its drool is harder to spot. 

**Notes**

Ribbons are classified as Imp-001, while the Reversed Ribbons are classified as Imp-001-1
