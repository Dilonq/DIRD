Ribbon

**Status:**
Unknown?

**Description:** 
The Ribbon mutation is one of the most deadly, because of it's behavior. It will make it's self seem scared, or frightened, to make it easier to group up with a crewmate. After this it will isolate, and completely devour it's victim, only leaving a hand or foot on the floor. Dead giveaways is the Ribbons drool, which will make it look like its sweating. Vote off any "crewmates" that show this behavior, and you'll be safe.
