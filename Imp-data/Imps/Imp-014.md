**Item #:** IMP-014

**Danger Level:** 1

**Rarity:** 4

**Codename:** The Guardian

**Description:** IMP-014 is a strangely friendly impostor that, true to its codename, will select and guard its victim rather than attacking them. It will stay by its victim's side and do its best to gain the victim's trust and/or keep the victim safe, even if it means killing other impostors right in front of the victim (thus sacrificing trust for safety). IMP-014 almost always has good intentions, and its reason for protecting its chosen victim seems to often be for the sake of love. It'll go on to attempt to ask out, date, and/or marry its victim if "for the sake of love" is their reasoning, and some healthy human x IMP-014 couples even have children (usually through adoption since cross-breeding is very complicated and could easily screw everything up).

Purple: "And stay down, you dirty killer..."
