White: "Why is the door locked- how did you get in brown?"

Brown: "Why do you need to know?"

[Brown opens their mouth, and video feed cuts off. When feed resumes, a white hand lays on the ground. Brown turns completely white, appearing identical to White. Brown enters a vent and flees the scene. Brown spots appear on the white hand, and moments later the hand is completely brown. Hours later, White and Black can be seen walking with each other, just before a corpse is reported.]
