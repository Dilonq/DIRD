IMP-003

**Danger Level:** ?

**Rarity:** Rumor

**Codename:** 
Poison

**Description:** 
The Poison Mutation.(This is based off a dream I had or nightmare.)This mutation is just a rumor for now.. It's quite deadly.It's behavior is that it likes standing in crowds of crewmates, then through microscopic holes in it's skin, it pumps poisonous gas.The gas cannot be seen,so the gas makes perfect kills in crowds,it's also immune to any poisons.(duh.)

**Incident Log:**

[XX/XX/20XX]

< Begin Log >

The first incident was in 13/10/2050, When crewmates were about to enter the Skeld, they saw mutiple dead bodies surrounding a lone poison impostor.That was the first incident of the Poison mutation, It was the 500th incident in the Skeld. There was no second Poison incident recorded after that, that's why it's a rumor. Although.. mutiple dead bodies surrounding a lone impostor has been spotted in Mira HQ and Potus.This may not be the last incident..(I will do a seperate one for acid.)
